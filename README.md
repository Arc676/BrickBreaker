# BrickBreaker

BrickBreaker game for Mac (not to be confused with Breakout); possibly coming to iOS at some point

## Gameplay

Click bubbles to automatically select all adjacent bubbles of the same color. Your score and the value of the selection appear in the window title bar. Press any key to pop the selected bubbles. Popping more bubbles at the same time yields more points.

BrickBreaker is highly customizable. Check the settings panel for customization options.
